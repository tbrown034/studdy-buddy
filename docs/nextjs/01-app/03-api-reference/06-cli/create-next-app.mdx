The `create-next-app` CLI allow you to create a new Next.js application using the default template or an [example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples) from a public GitHub repository. It is the easiest way to get started with Next.js.

Basic usage:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npx create-next-app@latest [project-name] [options]
```

## Examples

### With the default template

To create a new app using the default template, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npx create-next-app@latest
```

On installation, you'll see the following prompts:

```txt filename="Terminal"
What is your project named? my-app
Would you like to use the recommended Next.js defaults?
    Yes, use recommended defaults - TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS, App Router, Turbopack
    No, reuse previous settings
    No, customize settings - Choose your own preferences
```

If you choose to `customize settings`, you'll see the following prompts:

```txt filename="Terminal"
Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
Which linter would you like to use? ESLint / Biome / None
Would you like to use React Compiler? No / Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? No / Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? No / Yes
What import alias would you like configured? @/*
```

After the prompts, `create-next-app` will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.

### Linter Options

**ESLint**: The traditional and most popular JavaScript linter. Includes Next.js-specific rules from `@next/eslint-plugin-next`.

**Biome**: A fast, modern linter and formatter that combines the functionality of ESLint and Prettier. Includes built-in Next.js and React domain support for optimal performance.

**None**: Skip linter configuration entirely. You can always add a linter later.

Once you've answered the prompts, a new project will be created with your chosen configuration.

### With an official Next.js example

To create a new app using an official Next.js example, use the `--example` flag. For example:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npx create-next-app@latest --example [example-name] [your-project-name]
```

You can view a list of all available examples along with setup instructions in the [Next.js repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples).

### With any public GitHub example

To create a new app using any public GitHub example, use the `--example` option with the GitHub repo's URL. For example:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npx create-next-app@latest --example "https://github.com/.../" [your-project-name]
```

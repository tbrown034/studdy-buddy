description: Enable ViewTransition API from React in App Router
version: experimental
---

`viewTransition` is an experimental flag that enables the new [View Transitions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API) in React. This API allows you to leverage the native View Transitions browser API to create seamless transitions between UI states.

To enable this feature, you need to set the `viewTransition` property to `true` in your `next.config.js` file.

```js filename="next.config.js"
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    viewTransition: true,
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

> Important Notice: The `<ViewTransition>` Component is already available in React's Canary release channel.
> `experimental.viewTransition` is only required to enable deeper integration with Next.js features e.g. automatically
> [adding Transition types](https://react.dev/reference/react/addTransitionType) for navigations. Next.js specific transition types are not implemented yet.

## Usage

You can import the [`<ViewTransition>` Component](https://react.dev/reference/react/ViewTransition) from React in your application:

```jsx
import { ViewTransition } from 'react'
```

### Live Demo

Check out our [Next.js View Transition Demo](https://view-transition-example.vercel.app) to see this feature in action.

As this API evolves, we will update our documentation and share more examples. However, for now, we strongly advise against using this feature in production.

## Proxy

Proxy allows you to run code before a request is completed. Then, based on the incoming request, you can modify the response by rewriting, redirecting, modifying the request or response headers, or responding directly.

### Use cases

Some common scenarios where Proxy is effective include:

- Quick redirects after reading parts of the incoming request
- Rewriting to different pages based on A/B tests or experiments
- Modifying headers for all pages or a subset of pages

Proxy is _not_ intended for slow data fetching. While Proxy can be helpful for [optimistic checks](/docs/app/guides/authentication#optimistic-checks-with-proxy-optional) such as permission-based redirects, it should not be used as a full session management or authorization solution.

Using fetch with `options.cache`, `options.next.revalidate`, or `options.next.tags`, has no effect in Proxy.

### Convention

Create a `proxy.ts` (or `.js`) file in the project root, or inside `src` if applicable, so that it is located at the same level as `pages` or `app`.

> **Note**: While only one `proxy.ts` file is supported per project, you can still organize your proxy logic into modules. Break out proxy functionalities into separate `.ts` or `.js` files and import them into your main `proxy.ts` file. This allows for cleaner management of route-specific proxy, aggregated in the `proxy.ts` for centralized control. By enforcing a single proxy file, it simplifies configuration, prevents potential conflicts, and optimizes performance by avoiding multiple proxy layers.

### Example

```ts filename="proxy.ts" switcher
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

// This function can be marked `async` if using `await` inside
export function proxy(request: NextRequest) {
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/home', request.url))
}

// See "Matching Paths" below to learn more
export const config = {
  matcher: '/about/:path*',
}
```

```js filename="proxy.js" switcher
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

// This function can be marked `async` if using `await` inside
export function proxy(request) {
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/home', request.url))
}

// See "Matching Paths" below to learn more
export const config = {
  matcher: '/about/:path*',
}
```
